Lab 1a
------

Notes:

 * First we created tokens by parsing the input stream
   The definition of the token types etc. can be found in read_command.c

 * Next we cleaned up the token stream. This was done by removing extraneous
   newlines, finding malformed commands etc.

 * The tokens were then converted to commands in a separate function. Normal
   precedence ordering was used. For subshells, a subshell was parsed when the
   token stream began with a ( and ended with a ).

 * Redirects were parsed in the simple case.

 * A command tree for each command was returned. The command_stream is an 
   array of pointers to command trees


Limitations
-----------

 * There are some cases of malformed commands that are ignored. It works as
   required for all well-formed commands. 
   

Lab 1a
------

Notes:

 * We get commands in the form of command_t

 * We branch depending on what kind of command it is accounting for AND, OR, PIPE, SUBSHELL and also redirects and sequence
 
 * Comments describe functionality intricately

 * Since the parser for part A gave simple commands as a simple word - we used the strok command to split it and use execvp to run it


Limitations
-----------

 * We do not handle characters outside of the spec - since this is a subset of shell, we do not account for all possibilities by design
